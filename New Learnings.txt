1. 'dotenv' npm package.
    It allows you to store configuration settings for your application in a separate file (.env). 
    This includes API keys, database URLs, authentication credentials, and other configuration parameters.

    It enables you to configure your application differently for various environments (development, testing, production) 
    without modifying the actual code. 
    Each environment can have its own .env file with specific configurations.

    It helps maintain consistency across different environments. The same codebase can be deployed to multiple environments, 
    and each environment can have its own configuration without requiring changes to the code.


2. CORS- Cross Origin Resource Sharing
    It is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control how web pages in one domain can request 
    and interact with resources hosted on another domain. 

    The cors middleware allows you to configure various options, including:
    
    origin: Specifies which origins are allowed to access the resources.
    methods: Specifies the HTTP methods that are allowed when accessing the resources.
    allowedHeaders: Specifies which headers are allowed in the actual request.

3. Thunder Client
    It is a REST client extension for Visual Studio Code.

    It provides a user-friendly interface for creating and sending HTTP requests, 
    allowing developers to test their APIs directly within the VS Code environment.

4. The command 'npx tsc --init' initializes a TypeScript project by creating a tsconfig.json file in the current working directory.

    If TypeScript (tsc) is not installed globally, npx will temporarily install it from the npm registry.
    The TypeScript compiler (tsc) will generate a basic tsconfig.json file in the current working directory.

5. 'ts-node' is a TypeScript execution environment for Node.js. 
    
    It allows you to run TypeScript code directly in Node.js without the need to transpile it to JavaScript first. 
    It seamlessly integrates TypeScript with Node.js, providing a convenient way to develop and execute TypeScript scripts or applications.
